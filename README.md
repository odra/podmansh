Run "host commands" in containers.

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool to run CLIs in an isolated container while mounting/exposing certain 
pices of the host OS to said containers.

This is a bit different from Toolbx or Devcontainers whose focus aims to provide development
environment with containers.

This becomes a problem when using immutable systems such as ostree.
